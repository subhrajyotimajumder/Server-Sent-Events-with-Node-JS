# Server Sent Events
-----------------------


## Introduction
-------------------------

Server-Sent Events (SSE) is a server push technology enabling a client to receive automatic updates from a server via HTTP connection. The Server-Sent Events EventSource API is standardized as part of HTML5 by the W3C.


The examples provided here are implemented using Node JS for the server and plain JS for the HTML file.

The example only works in Chrome and Safari.

More information about SSEs can be found at http://www.html5rocks.com/tutorials/eventsource/basics/

The code in this tutorial are extracted from the demo links at the bottom of the page.




## Running the examples
--------------------------

Assuming you have node installed:
> `node install` 
> 
> `node server.js`

Preferred open multiple browser(Chrome/Safari): localhost:8000/sse-node.html

Note: Presumed that node js >10 is installed in the system
